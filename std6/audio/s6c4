(3) Landslides/building collapse: Landslides are caused by heavy rain, earthquakes, or human activities like deforestation. Building collapses result from structural failures, poor construction, or natural disasters.
(4) Storms: Storms are caused by atmospheric disturbances due to temperature, pressure differences, and moisture in the air.
(5) Earthquakes: Earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates along faults or volcanic activity. These shifts release energy, creating seismic waves.

Question. 5. What first aid will you provide in the following situations?
